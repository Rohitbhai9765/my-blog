Everett's and Deutsch's theories challenge the very nature of reality. The many worlds theory is one that overturns our conception of existence itself. Its consequences are staggering.

For example, think of all the times that you had to make a crucial decision in your life, such as what job to apply for, whom to marry, whether to have children. One may spend hours on a lazy afternoon thinking of all the things that might have been. The many worlds theory says that there is a parallel universe with a copy of yourself, living out a totally different life story. In one universe, you may be a billionaire contemplating your next headline-making adventure. In another universe, you may be a pauper wondering where your next meal will come from. Or you may be living somewhere in between, toiling at a boring, tedious job with a low, steady income but no future. In each universe, you insist that your universe is the real one, and all the others are fake. Now imagine this at a quantum level. Each individual atomic action splits our universe into multiples of itself.

In Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken," he wrote about something that everyone has thought about in their daydreams. We wonder what might have happened during times in our lives when we made a critical choice. These momentous decisions may affect our lives ever after. He wrote:

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth.

He ends the poem by concluding that his decision had epic consequences for his life, that the road less traveled was a turning point. He concludes:

I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
