# Welcome to My First Blog!

This is where I can write my first post using Markdown. Itâ€™s super simple and easy.

## Here's How Markdown Works

You can add **bold**, *italic*, and even [links](https://example.com).

You can also add code blocks:

```js
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
