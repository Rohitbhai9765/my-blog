Even as a child, Fritz Haber was fascinated by chemistry, often performing experiments by him-self. His father was a prosperous merchant importing dyes and pig-ments, and he would sometimes help in his father's chemical factory. He was part of a rising generation of European Jews who were successfully in business and science, but he eventually converted to Christianity. But above all, he was a nationalist, with a firm desire to help Germany with his knowledge of chemistry.

He focused on a number of chemical mysteries, including how to harness the nitrogen found in the air into useful products, such as fertilizer as well as explosives. He realized that the only way to split the two nitrogen atoms apart was to apply enormous pressure and temperature. By brute force, the nitrogen bonds could be broken, he theorized. He made history by finding the right magical combination in the laboratory. If you heated the nitrogen gas found in air to 300 degrees C and compressed it with the pressure of 200 to 300 times atmospheric pressure, then it was possible to finally break the nitrogen molecule apart and have it recombine with hydrogen to form ammonia, which is NH3. For the first time in history, chemistry could be used to feed the world's rising population.

He would win the Nobel Prize in 1918 for this pioneering work. Today, about half the nitrogen molecules in your body are a direct consequence of Haber's discovery, so his enduring legacy is imprinted in your atoms. The world population today is over 8 billion people, and we could not feed this population without his work.

But his process is so energy hungry, requiring nitrogen to be compressed and heated to enormous pressures and temperatures, that it consumes 2 percent of the world's energy output.

Fertilizers were not the only thing on Haber's mind. Being a Ger-man nationalist, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the German army during World War I, and the energy stored in the nitrogen molecule could be harnessed to create life-giving fertilizer as well as fatal explosives. (Even amateur terrorists are aware of this process. A fertilizer bomb, capable of leveling an entire apartment building, consists of ordinary fertilizers saturated with fuel oil.) Thus, Haber used another by-product of his process, nitrates, to contribute to Germany's vast war machine, creating explosive chemical weapons in addition to poison gas that would take many innocent lives.

So, ironically, the man whose mastery of chemistry expanded the world population also doomed the lives of thousands of innocents.

He is also known as the Father of Chemical Warfare.

But there is also a tragic aspect to his life. His wife, a pacifist, would commit suicide, perhaps due to her opposition to his research in chemical warfare and poison gas. Despite his decades of work supporting the government and the German military, he felt the wave of anti-Semitism sweeping the country in the 1930s. Although he was a few who had converted to Christianity, he left the country to seek refuge elsewhere and died of poor health in 1934. During World War II, the Nazi army would use Zyklon gas, a poison gas that was developed and perfected by Haber, to kill many of his own relatives in concentration camps.
